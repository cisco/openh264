# OpenH264

This is [OpenH264](https://github.com/cisco/openh264), packaged for
[Zig](https://ziglang.org/).

## Status



## Installation

First, update your `build.zig.zon`:

```bash
zig fetch --save git+https://github.com/gerwin3/openh264.git
```

### To use the Zig-friendly bindings

Add this snippet to your `build.zig` script:

```zig
const openh264_dep = b.dependency("openh264", .{
    .target = target,
    .optimize = optimize,
});
your_compilation.root_module.addImport("openh264", openh264_dep.module("openh264"));
```

You can now import and use the `openh264` module. See the `examples` directory
for usage. This will automatically link the OpenH264 library.

### To use the raw bindings

Add this snippet to your `build.zig` script:

```zig
const openh264_dep = b.dependency("openh264", .{
    .target = target,
    .optimize = optimize,
});
your_compilation.root_module.addImport("openh264_bindings", openh264_dep.module("openh264_bindings"));
```

You can now import and use the `openh264_bindings` module. See the `examples`
directory for usage. This will automatically link the OpenH264 library.

### To use the static OpenH264 library without bindings

Add this snippet to your `build.zig` script:

```zig
const openh264_dep = b.dependency("openh264", .{
    .target = target,
    .optimize = optimize,
});
your_compilation.linkLibrary(openh264_dep.artifact("openh264"));
```

This will provide OpenH264 as a static library to `your_compilation` without the
included bindings.

## Known Issues

* Windows is not supported since the Zig `nasm` dependency [does not work on
Windows](https://github.com/allyourcodebase/nasm/issues/3) at this time.

## Contribute

This repo is a stripped down version of the original OpenH264 repository:

* The console application has been removed.
* All testing code has been removed. Testing is not part of this package.
* All build stuff has been replaced with Zig.

In practice this means that only the `codec` directory remains, since it
contains the sources.

It should work on most platforms and architectures, but has only been tested on
Linux x86_64. If anything is broken or missing please inspect `build.zig` and
update accordingly. Use the original Meson build files as reference.
Specifically, you may want to update the `BuildConfiguration` for your platform
and architecture to ensure correct compilation of assembly code.
