OpenH264
========

This repo has no code yet - that might seem a bit weird but let us explain.... 

Cisco is working on getting the code separated from dependancies. We
want to checking that there are no existing known security
vulnerabilities listed against it because existing products use this
code and it would be bad to zero day our own products. We also go
through a legal process to open source code that takes time.

Right now the only thing in the repo is the HTML for the
www.openh264.org website in the gh-pages branch.


Open Source H.264 Codec 
----------------------

This goal of this project is to have a BSD licensed open source H.264
codec that is suitable for use in real time applications such as
WebRTC.
