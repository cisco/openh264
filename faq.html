          <p> <strong>Q. When will the H.264 source code and binary module be available?</strong><br />
            A: The first step of making the source code available is
            complete. Cisco will form a governance board for the open source
            initiative, establish the project, and make the source code and
            binary module available for download. We will move quickly to carry
            out these steps, but past experience suggests that it will take a
            few months before the entire process is complete. </p>
          
          <p> <strong>Q. Can I take advantage of the H.264 codec binary module in my project?</strong><br />
            A: Yes. Your users can download this module to utilize the H.264
            video codec with your project.</p>
          
          <p> <strong>Q. Why is Cisco making both source and binary versions
          available?</strong><br />
          A: The source code is available so that an implementation of H.264
          is available for the community to use across any project, and to
          leverage the community to make the codec better for all. We will
          select licensing terms that allow for this code to be used in
          commercial products as well as open source projects. In order for
          Cisco to be responsible for the MPEG LA licensing royalties for the
          module, Cisco must provide the packaging and distribution of this code
          in a binary module format (think of it like a plug-in, but not using
          the same APIs as existing plugins), in addition to several other
          constraints. This gives the community the best of all worlds - a team
          can choose to use the source code, in which case the team is
          responsible for paying all applicable license fees, or the team can
          use the binary module distributed by Cisco, in which case Cisco will
          cover the MPEG LA licensing fees. </p>

          <p> <strong>Q: Is Cisco guaranteeing that it will pay other licensing
            fees for H.264, should additional patent holders assert claims in
            the future?<br />  </strong>A: Cisco is providing no such guarantee.  We are only
            covering the royalties that would apply to the binary module under
            MPEG LA's AVC/H.264 patent pool.</p>

          <p> <strong>Q: If I use the source code in my product, and then
          distribute that product on my own, will Cisco cover the MPEG LA
          licensing fees which I'd otherwise have to pay? </strong><br />

            A: No. Cisco is only covering the licensing fees for its own binary
            module, and products or projects that utilize it must download it at
            the time the product or project is installed on the user's computer
            or device. Cisco will not be liable for any licensing fees incurred
            by other parties. </p>

          <p> <strong>Q.</strong> <strong>I'm a competitor of Cisco making a
          commercial product. Can I still take advantage of the H.264 module in
          my project? </strong><br />

            A: Yes. If everyone has at least one video codec in common, our
            products will be able to communicate. That increases the number of
            other people everyone's products can talk to. The network effect
            helps everyone. </p>

          <p> <strong>Q. How will the open source project be governed?</strong><br />
            A: We will form a board consisting of leaders from the open source
            community as well as Unified Communication vendors. </p>

          <p> <strong>Q. What source code license will you use?</strong><br />
            A: The code utilizes a BSD license. </p>

          <p> <strong>Q. What platforms will you support?</strong><br />
            A: Our initial plan is to support Linux (x86 and ARM), Windows (XP
            forward), OSX, and Android. The governance board can decide to add
            additional platforms. As long as there are ports of the source code
            and automatic build scripts contributed as part of the open source,
            we do not see difficulties in adding additional platforms.
            </p>

          <p> <strong>Q. iOS is noticeably absent from the list of
            platforms. Why is that?</strong><br /> A: Unfortunately, iOS does
            not allow for applications to fetch and install modules from the
            Internet once that application has been installed on the
            device. Consequently, it is simply not feasible for us to provide a
            distribution at this time. <br /> </p>

          <p> <strong>Q. Where will the project be hosted?</strong><br />
            A: Initially at <a href="http://www.openh264.org"
            target="_blank">www.openh264.org</a>. </p>

          <p> <strong>Q. Where will the source code repository be hosted?</strong><br />
            A: Eventually at <a href="http://imgflip.com/i/4hvnk"
            target="_blank">https://github.com/cisco/openh264</a>. </p>

          <p> <strong>Q. Which profiles of H.264 will be supported?</strong><br />
            A: The initial code has the baseline profile. We look forward to
            working with the open source community to add high profile and
            others. </p>
